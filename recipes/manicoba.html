        <h2 class="h2">Amazonian cassava leaves stew</h2>
        <p>
            Manicoba is a traditional Amazonian dish very popular in the north of Brazil.
            It has recently gained attention for a peculiar reason: it can be poisonous if prepared incorrectly.
            Despite the <em>danger</em> this recipe is widely consumed in the country and it's delicious.
            The prep time is around a week and it serves about 35-40 people.
