        <p>
            You're about to be one of the very few people privileged enough
            to have access to this brownie recipe that me and my husband
            came up with <em>(or almost)</em>. 
            This brownie is thin, chewy and you'll be dreaming
            of it for days.
        </p>
        <p>
            She beauty! <em>*mwah*</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            And you definitely won't be finding this recipe
            anywhere else on the internet!
            <strong>Don't look on YouTube!</strong> It's definitely not there.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>113g of butter, unsalted</li>
            <li>50g of cocoa powder</li>
            <li>396g of sweet condensed milk (a can)</li>
            <li>120g of powdered sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt (only if you use unsalted butter)</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>90g of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup of chocolate chips (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Get your oven heating to 160Â°C.</li>
            <li>Line your pan with parchment paper (batter is very sticky) - I use a 23cm square pan.</li>
            <li>Put the butter in a mid-sized pot and heat over medium until it melts and the water boils out.</li>
            <li>Stir the butter as it starts to brown, to keep milk solids from sticking to the bottom.</li>
            <li>When the butter is browning and smelling like caramel, whisk in the cocoa powder.</li>
            <li>Let the cocoa powder boil for a minute then take the pot off the heat.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the sweet condensed milk, then the powdered sugar until it's fully dissolved.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the salt, vanilla extract and the egg yolk.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the flour.</li>
            <li>If you want to add the chocolate chips, let the batter cool down first or they'll melt.</li>
            <li>Get the batter in the pan and bake it for 30-40 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Let it cool down completely before you cut it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy it! I also recommend adding a bit of the hot brownie to a plate with a scoop of ice cream! It's yummy!!</li>
        </ol>
