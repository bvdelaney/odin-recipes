        <p>
            Brigadeiro (bree-gah-day-ro) is a very traditional treat from Brazil 
            and it has an interesting story.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1939 - 1945 after World War II, 
            Brazil was in campaign time for the election of a new president.
            The candidate Eduardo Gomes, 
            whose military rank was Brigadier (brigadeiro), 
            had enormous success among women, 
            which was evidenced by his slogan of the campaign that was 
            "Vote for the Brigadier who is handsome and single!"
        </p>
        <p>
            His most devoted voters decided to try to promote his campaign 
            by organizing parties to raise funds and to give even more 
            visibility to their candidate. 
            Contrary to selling the usual electoral merchandising, 
            they decided to make a candy to be sold in these meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was created what was then known as "the candy of the Brigadeiro" 
            and was sold during the campaign, 
            trying to achieve votes through the palate of the electorate.
            The candy was a success, 
            but the candidate turned out not to be elected.
